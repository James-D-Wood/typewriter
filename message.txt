1st soldier with a keen interest in birds: Where'd you get the coconuts?

King Arthur: We found them.

Soldier: Found them? In Mercia? The coconut's tropical!

KA: What do you mean?

Soldier: Well, this is a temperate zone

KA: The swallow may fly south with the sun or the house martin or the plover may seek warmer climes in winter, yet these are not strangers to our land?

Soldier: Are you suggesting coconuts migrate?

KA: Not at all. They could be carried.

Soldier: What? A swallow carrying a coconut?

KA: It could grip it by the husk!

Soldier: It's not a question of where he grips it! It's a simple question of weight ratios! A five ounce bird could not carry a one pound coconut.

KA: Well, it doesn't matter. Will you go and tell your master that Arthur from the Court of Camelot is here?

Soldier: Listen. In order to maintain air-speed velocity, a swallow needs to beat its wings forty-three times every second, right?

KA: Please!

Soldier: Am I right?
